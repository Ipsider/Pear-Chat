## Usage

This is a simple peer-to-peer based group chat application. To start a network, simply enter a 
username and connect without entering any IP address.

If you want to join an existing chat network, you have to enter any IP address from which you know it
exists in the network. The peers will then be able to gather more information and find other peers.
